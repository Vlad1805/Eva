The most northerly point of land on Earth is somewhere just north of mainland Greenland, but is a contentious issue due to variation of definition. How permanent some of the contenders are makes hard determination difficult, but sets an important threshold. Problematic issues include ice sheets, water movements and inundation, storm activity that may build, shift, or destroy banks of moraine material, and observational difficulties due to remoteness. 
The following table sets out the main contenders for this title.

Currently, Kaffeklubben Island is the most northerly, undisputed candidate among the land areas considered permanent that remain above water.
